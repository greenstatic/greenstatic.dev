Together with Charisa we spotted in September 2021 a couple of figures constructed from tiles on various buildings (often around major intersections) scattered around Ljubljana, Slovenia.

It took many weeks of searching various search terms:
* Figurice ob križiščih Ljubljana
* Figurice Ljubljana
* Dragons Ljubljana
* Mozaiki na fasadah Ljubljana
* Mozaiki na stavbah Ljubljana
* Ceramic tile mosaics Ljubljana

Charisa managed to track down the whole concept of these mysterious figures.
They are [Space Invaders](https://space-invaders.com/) placed by an UFA (Unidentified Free Artist) from France all around the world (checkout the [world invasion map](https://space-invaders.com/world/)).
Space Invaders are ceramic tile mosaics placed on various buildings throughout cities being "invaded". 
Users can download the free mobile application "Flash invaders" ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flashinvaders/id895180919), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ltu.flashInvader&hl=en_US&gl=US)) and start flashing them (taking a picture) thereby getting points and competing on the global scoreboard. 
The app ensures you are physically at the location of the Space Invader and upon snapping a picture of the mosaic, the invader gets added to your gallery of found Space Invaders (and of course you gain a couple of points).

Finding various information about the exact locations of all Space Invaders in Ljubljana proved quite difficult, some websites contain wrong (off by +300m) coordinates, others only contain a couple of invaders while some don't mention any location only a picture of the invader. 

After taking a weekend to surf through the web, collecting as many different sources (websites, picture sharing platforms, social media etc.) we started compiling a list of Space Invaders in Ljubljana.
After spending an entire day hunting for Space Invaders, we decided to publish our list so that other people who stumble upon these mysterious creatures can track them down and have a super fun weekend.
Our list is currently not complete but will get updated as we track the remaining invaders down.
